We wanted to bring the world of Jazz and ALL music in general to passerbys. Believe it or not my muse was 'Lo-Fi Jazz Cafe meets Cowboy  Beebop' 😂. You'll have to see for yourself 😉. We also have a cozy cafe area in the main lobby and an Art Studio-esque setup in the loft upstairs. Our recently added services include an On-Site Artist for live portraits! We also have an On-Site fortune teller! So if you're into the mystic arts and curious about what your future has in store then please seek out the mysterious Lady Clea on your next visit. So drop in and share a drink and vibe with wandering minstrels practicing their arts. You bring your Soul and we bring the vibes!",

        "description": "Eorzeans look for a solace. Their own little spot in the corner of the world to just get away from it all. Sometimes a regular club just won't do it for them. Some folk need a bit more intimacy. That's what Trionfi is for. With a cozy atmosphere, the jazz lounge and bar is one of the few spaces in Eorzea where one can vent to a stranger, relax a bit and chill out with close friends in a smaller setting.",
